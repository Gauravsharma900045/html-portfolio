<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p> Hello! I'm Gaurav Kumar, a passionate and curious learner currently pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology
(2024–2028). I'm on an exciting journey to become a software engineer, driven by a deep interest in solving real-world
problems through technology.</p>
 <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with C++ and diving into the world of web
development. I enjoy building a strong foundation in computer science while also exploring creative areas like
photography and singing, which help me stay balanced and expressive.</p>  
  <p> Beyond code, I’m someone who loves to read books, play chess, travel, and explore new ideas and perspectives. Whether
it's a new framework, a hidden travel spot, or a deep philosophical question—I enjoy discovering and learning about
everything.</p> 
  <p> I believe in growing step by step, and this portfolio is my first one—just the beginning of many things I aim to build.
Let's connect, learn, and grow together!</p>
